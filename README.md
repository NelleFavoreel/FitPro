# Front-end web 2
This is my repository for front-end this contains the frontend code.

## Overview

Frontend ensure that the website is user-friendly, accessible, and provides a positive experience for the end-users.

This is my website. It is a platform with a schedule for various sports exercises, designed especially for women who want to exercise more but struggle to find motivation.

## Working

To have everything functioning properly, you need to start 'nodemon index.js' in the backend first. Otherwise, no data will be retrieved from the database.


Enjoy :)
