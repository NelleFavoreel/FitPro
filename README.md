# Front-end web 2
This is my repository for front-end this contains the frontend code.

## Overview

Frontend ensure that the website is user-friendly, accessible, and provides a positive experience for the end-users.

This is my website. It is a platform with a schedule for various sports exercises, designed especially for women who want to exercise more but struggle to find motivation.

## Working

To have everything functioning properly, you need to start 'nodemon index.js' in the backend first. Otherwise, no data will be retrieved from the database.

## Testing exercises

If you want to test, focus on sorting by 'more than an hour', 'upper body', and 'beginner'. Because that's where most exercises are located. There are too many exercises to include all of them in the database, so I mainly focused on these categories.
